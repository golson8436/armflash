# Welcome to the armflash project page #


**armflash** is a command line utility for flashing (loading firmware into) **multiple** ARM core based chips/mcus at the same time. The project is still in the begining but the intentions are to support wide range of devices and multiple operating systems.

Currently supported devices are:

  * lpc2103 (Phillips)

Currently supported operating systems are:

  * Linux, BSD
  * Mac OSX

Work in progress:
  * Support for the whole lpc21xx family
  * Support for the lpc23xx family
  * Support for the aduc702x (Analog Devices) family
  * armflash-gui simple QT4 gui for armflash

By supported I mean that I actually tested it and it worked.
